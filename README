This project is aimed to improve the leaked CS:GO code, to make it more stable and to make it playable.

Partially used code from https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike (some econ stuff, weapon recoil).

Features:
- Removed Scaleform;
- Filesystem from TF2 leak (less hardcoded stuff, allows for 'custom' folder, etc);
- Some VGUI stuff and complete GameUI ported from TF2 leak;
